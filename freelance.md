I've built iOS apps for discovering and watching video, introduced new people
to iOS development, worked on CMS projects in Rails and built a lot of APIs.

I've worked with organisations in the UK and Europe, including [The RSA][]
(with [Torchbox][]), [GAIN][], [Plymouth University][], [Cucumber Ltd][] and
several others.

Brandon, VP of Engineering at [SleepIO][] had this to say:

> “Nick worked with us on the prototype of our new mobile application. We were
> just getting our feet wet in iOS development, and Nick helped bring our
> internal engineering team up to speed quickly. In addition to his coding
> skills, he was a great guy to work with — personable and able to interact
> with all members of the team, developers and non-developers alike.”

I've got good availability through July and August. Think I'd be a good fit for 
your project? Email me: [nick@nickcharlton.net][email].
