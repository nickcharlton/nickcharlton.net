After a request by <a href="http://twitter.com/nickcharlton/status/3884874880">Peter Upfold</a> on Twitter for ideas for a screencast, I suggested he do something on Public Key Authentication. My wish was made true as he made it up yesterday. 

<p class="center"><object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6523718&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=&fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6523718&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=&fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object></p>

I was rather surprised to hear myself mentioned, so a huge hat tip (presumes a huge hat, I guess...) to Peter for doing that.

Thanks!
