For a project several weeks in the making, I've just pushed up the changes to
this, my site. I started working on all of this way back when I was still on
placement, but then also through Young Rewired State and intermittently
since. It's been at once the bane of my todo list, and a joy to work on,
experimenting, refactoring and of course, writing.

It's in no-way perfect, but it's a significant improvement from my orignal
version.

Like most of my projects, it's also up on
[GitHub](http://github.com/nickcharlton/nickcharlton.net).

## Posts

There's a few posts which I've finally been able to post. Most of these had
been sat around as drafts, others needed a bit of completion. But, without
further ado, my last few months:

* [NSConf Mini: Developers vs. Designers](/posts/nsconf-mini.html)
* [dConstruct 2012](/posts/dconstruct-2012.html)
* [Young Rewired State 2012](/posts/young-rewired-state-2012.html)
* [Finishing at Rokk Media](/posts/finishing-at-rokk-media.html)

I'm now a good few weeks into the final-year of my degree and so my focus has
(necessarily) shifted quite a bit. My focus from now on will be mostly centred
around [Python](http://python.org/), [Qt](http://qt.digia.com) 
(using [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro) and 
some OpenGL), Robotics, 
[GPU Computation using CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html) and
various AI topics. I already have a few drafts relating to these in the works
(I find it a great way to learn). I will also be occasionally posting about my
degree project &mdash; a Quadrotor platform, Simulator and associated mapping
algorithms. It's going to be an interesting year.
