# The Source of nickcharlton.net

A thing of many decendants, this version is implemented using [Hyde](), the
Python static site generator. Previous versions have been implemented in
Sinatra, Jekyll, Wordpress and countless others. I guess everyone needs their
plaything…

## Usage

It requires nothing other than an install of Hyde.

    git clone git://github.com/nickcharlton/nickcharlton.net.git
    cd nickcharlton.net
    hyde gen; hyde serve
    open http://localhost:8080/

Static site generators are notoriously hard to get working without other
examples (especially when you already have a way of doing things.) So please
use it as an example (but, have some taste about my design…)
