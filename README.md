# The Source of nickcharlton.net

A thing of many decendants, this version is implemented using [Hakyll][], a static 
site generator written in Haskell. Previous versions have been implemented in 
Sinatra, Jekyll, Wordpress and countless others.

## Usage

Setup Haskell, `cabal install hakyll`, then:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/nickcharlton/nickcharlton.net.git
cd nickcharlton.net
ghc --make site.hs
./site preview
open http://localhost:8000/
```

Static site generators are notoriously hard to get working without other
examples (especially when you already have a way of doing things.) So please
use it as an example (but, have some taste about my designâ€¦)
