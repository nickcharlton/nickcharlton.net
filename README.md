# nickcharlton.net

This is the source of https://nickcharlton.net. It's existed for many years,
but the current version is implemented using [Jekyll][], a static site
generator written in Haskell. Previous versions have been implemented in
[Sinatra][], [Hakyll][], and countless others.

## Usage

```bash
git clone git://github.com/nickcharlton/nickcharlton.net.git
cd nickcharlton.net
bundle
jekyll s
```

Static site generators can be a bit of a pain to get working with from nothing,
so feel free to use this as an example to base your implementation off of.
