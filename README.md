# Sinba: A Blogging Engine in Ruby.

Sinba is a handson* blogging engine inspired by [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/ "Tumblr"), [Markdoc](http://markdoc.org/ "Markdoc Documentation Â» 
        Index"), [Chirp](http://chyrp.net/ "Chyrp") & [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyll"). It's designed around short blogging, and blogging code. It's based upon Sinatra.

It uses erb for templating, ActiveRecord for storing posts (and SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, etc), Markdown for markup, Google's Code Prettify for syntax highlighting & Facebox for modal windows.

* By hands-on, I mean that you need to do a lot of tasks manually. It's designed to streamline posting, but not a lot else.

# Features

* Simple, Markdown formatted posting.
* Templates for pages.
* Multiple Authors.
	- be warned, there are no privileges.
* Search
    - currently only searches for word matches in titles.
* Basic Tagging
    - currently limited to just applying tags to posts.

# Documentation

It's a Sinatra app, so, you can deploy it onto somewhere like Heroku, or [read here about deploying Sinatra](http://sinatra-book.gittr.com/#deployment "Sinatra Book").

## Admin Section.

Navigate to /admin and you'll be asked to login. 

It supports more than one user for authentication, but no privileges. You can either login and do everything, or do nothing.

Once you've logged in, you'll be redirected to the frontpage, where you will be able to see some more options. These will load a modal window for the option you chose, over the rest of the site.

## The Rest.

You should just be able to see the rest out of the box. On first load, it'll create all of your database tables, and pull in layouts and templates. It follows the Rails convention of /views and /public/stylesheets & /public/javascript for additions.

# Version History

* 0.1: Initial version, supporting just the basics.
