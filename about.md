## About

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at [Plymouth University](http://plym.ac.uk/). I like making things.

I'm interested in what we can do with the always-connected, sensor packed
devices we have in our pockets. How can we use that to make things better? Be
it finding a better way to finish off some errands, see something spectacular
in the sky or in robots that collaborate with each other to complete tasks.

But also; what about making products ourselves? Why can't we manufacture
a spare part in our own home? Fortunately, these two broad interests come
together with a few of the [projects I'm working on](/projects.html).

I like iOS (I just spent a year of placement building products, and I have
a few others in progress, too), Python, well written web services, and Haskell
interests me. I also care about design &mdash; it's fascinating.
