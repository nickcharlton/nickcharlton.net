## About

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at [Plymouth University][]. I like
making things.

I'm interested in what we can do with the always-connected, sensor packed
devices we have in our pockets. How can we use that to make things better? Be
it finding a better way to finish off some errands, see something spectacular
in the sky or in robots that collaborate with each other to complete tasks.

But also; what about making products ourselves? Why can't we manufacture
a spare part in our own home? Fortunately, these two broad interests come
together with a few of the [projects I'm working on][projects].

I've worked with iOS quite extensively, usually build stuff with Python and I 
rather like Haskell. I try to instill a sense of design, and style into everything 
I do. It's not just form, it's also function and we can have both.
