## About

I'm a Freelance iOS Developer. But I also work with Ruby, Python and know my way 
around Linux sys. admin. I delight in building software which satisfying to use and 
is accessible to all.

I've worked on projects which have involved geolocation and coordinate type 
conversion, media streaming, resumable downloads and AirPlay support along with 
hardware interaction with Android and various sensors.

Outside of iOS and Android, I've built lots of small web services like [moviesapi][] 
which gives you a programmable way to access movie showings in the UK, and I'm 
currently working on [Predict the Sky][] â€” a combination of a web service and set 
of apps to tell you what you will be able to see in the sky tonight. 

I'm involved with the [Young Rewired State][] centre in Plymouth, 
[Plymouth Web Dev Meetup][], and my old Universities' [Computing Society][TermiSoc] 
and a few other things.

I'm currently on the hunt for projects for 2014. Interested? [Email me][].
