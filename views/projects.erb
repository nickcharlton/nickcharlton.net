		<h2>Projects</h2>
	    <p>I'm quite prolific with projects. Some of the ones below are side products of other things. Some of these have been worked on for quite a long time before being released, others can be considered more hacks.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Where's Next?</h3>

            <p>Nobody really likes doing errands. How about a way to help you do them quicker?</p>
            <p>Where's Next? takes the places you need to visit and according to where you are now tells you the quickest way to visit them.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://wheresnextapp.com/">Where's Next? Site</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wheres-next/id454450198?mt=8">On the App Store</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Jacks</h3>

            <p>Jacks is a web development framework. It's designed to be a starting point for responsive designs. It's intended to provide the basic elements for you, whilst you work on the rest.</p>

            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>

		<h3><a href="http://github.com/nickcharlton">From GitHub</a>)</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="<%= repo['url'] %>"><%= repo['name'] %></a> &mdash; <%= repo['description'] %></li>
		</ul>
